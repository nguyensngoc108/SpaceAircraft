## About

### 📌 General Information:
- __Game name:__ **Space Aircraft**

- __Category:__ **2D, Action, Shooting, Single player**

-  __Lore:__
      _As the Earth becomes hotter, drought and disease ravage the population,
       Scientists look for a new planet - one that can support human life.
       In 2099, they found it. You and your teammates are sent by the government
       to explore this planet, which is protected by 3 guardians. The appearance 
       of humans made them worried about the safety of the planet, so they created 
       meteor storms to attack you. Your teammates have sacrificed and you are the
       Earth's only hope right now. Don't let them down._

### 🎮 Rule:
- The rule is simple, dodge the asteroids and shoot the guardian at the same time.
The key is how you show your flexibility in this game.
